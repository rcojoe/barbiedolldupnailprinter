Barbie Doll'd Up Nail Printer is a Digital nail printer from 2010 that was short lived due to a shortage of Ink cartridges

Barbie's short lived nail printer was ahead of it's time.  The printer uses a Lexmark print head, controller and driver.  
The proprietary PH had a ID code of 78 which was checked by the windows front end software.

The software versions that I have found:
1.0.0.24 - Possible first published version
1.0.0.25 - The version that came on my CD
1.0.0.27 - The version that the update server says is the most recent but is no longer available to download.

After searching for any articles concerning a replacement cartridge, I found this blogpost from 2014 describing how to install
the legacy drivers on windows 7.

In Sander Schutten article, he was very detailed on how he went through and was able to install the drivers, but in windows 10, I tried the same
approach but didn't have as good of results since I was not able to edit the install package in its signed package.  I wound up
installing it in "Windows Vista Compatability Mode" for the "Barbie Doll'd Up Nails Printer Driver (x64).exe".  The main Barbie program
installed without issue.
